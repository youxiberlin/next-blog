I developed this blog-oriented static site, using Next.js.

There are some reasons why I decided to develop this site.

I think that the biggest motivation is actually that I just wanted to develop this to get better understanding of Next.js. I already had experience with Next.js when I collaborated with the other developers, but as I had little experience developing everything from scratch, I thought building my own blog would help me better understand how Next.js works. 

Also, there are some other libraries that I wanted to try out with Next.js such as **tailwindcss** and **remark**. I actually enjoyed using them on this project.

My former blog that I devloped almost 3 years ago was developed with Jekyll and published on a github page. That was about when I started to learn to code from zero, and the project really helped me have more and better experience with how web development works.

But some time passed by since then, and I started feeling that the Jekyll blog doesn't much meet my aim anymore, as I wanted to used the other techstacks.

So, this time I developed this and it was a rewarding experience.

Basically, I refered this <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter" target="_blank">blog example</a>.
